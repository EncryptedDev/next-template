# Next.js Template

Bored on Christmas Day, decided to make this template to assist with my future
projects. Use as you wish, just credit me.

Template for Next.js (TypeScript) & Tailwind CSS

## Deloyment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our
[Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more
details.
